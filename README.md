## Overview
The **Content Analysis Dashboard** is a project designed to track, analyze, and visualize my content consumption across various streaming platforms over the last three years. Using Python for data retrieval and preprocessing, and Power BI for visualization, the project also integrates the TMDB API to enrich the dataset with additional information.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Automated data scraping from multiple streaming platforms, including Netflix, with additional details filled in via the TMDB API.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and structured data using Python and Pandas to ensure accuracy.
- **Dashboard**: Visualized data using Power BI, showcasing trends, genres, and viewing patterns.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data scraping and preprocessing.
- **TMDB API**: Used to fetch additional movie and TV show details.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive and dynamic dashboards.
- **Streamlit**: Front-end for showcasing the dashboard (if applicable).
